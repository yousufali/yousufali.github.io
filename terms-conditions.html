<h3>AGREEMENT </h3><br>

<h5>Section 1</h5>

<p>1.2. <b>Orders.</b> Each Order shall specify at the placement level: (a) the types of inventory to be delivered (e.g., impressions, clicks, or other desired actions); (b) the prices for such inventory; and if specified by CorpTag (c) the Total Spend. Using such factors, the Order shall set forth the Approved Monthly Delivery and the Approved Monthly Spend.

Publisher acknowledges that CorpTag bills its Advertisers, and pays its Publishers, based on actual delivery. </p>

<p>2.2. <b>Liability for Publisher's Revenue.</b> Publisher understands and agrees that CorpTag acts solely as an agent for the Advertisers; and that CorpTag shall only be liable to Publisher for Publishers Revenue based on payments from Advertisers that it has received without restrictions that constitute immediately-available funds to CorpTag (hereinafter called "Cleared Funds").

Publisher shall notify CorpTag in writing that it disputes the calculation within 75 days after the last calendar day of the month in question. All CorpTag calculated payments after that period shall be deemed to be correct and final.</li>
<li style="list-style:outside;"><b>	Disputes </b>
<li style="list-style:outside;">If Publisher issues an invoice. If Publisher issues an invoice, and CorpTag disputes all or a portion it, CorpTag shall pay the part of the invoice that is undisputed.

<p>3.6. <b>Fraudulent Impressions.</b> Any method to artificially and/or fraudulently inflate the volume of impressions or clicks is strictly forbidden. Counts of impressions or clicks will be decided solely on the basis of reports generated by CorpTag's Advertising Network. These prohibited methods include but are not limited to: framing an ad-banner's click-through destination, auto-spawning of browsers, blind text links, running 'spiders' against the Publisher's own website, automatic redirecting of users, pop-up windows or any other technique of generating automatic or fraudulent (as determined by CorpTag, acting reasonably, or based on industry practices) click-throughs and/or impressions. Advertising Material may not be placed on a page which reloads automatically. Publisher may not require users to click on Advertising Material prior to entering a Web Site or any area therein or provide incentives of any nature to encourage or require users to click on Advertising Material. Publisher's clicks-throughs of any link other than CorpTag's Advertising Material, or use of any other means of artificially enhancing click results shall be a material breach of this Agreement, and upon such occurrence, CorpTag may terminate this Agreement effective upon delivery of notice. Such termination is at the sole discretion of CorpTag and is not in lieu of any other remedy available at law or equity. CorpTag's ad server will be the official counter for determining the number of Advertising Material delivered under an applicable Order, and amounts payable under this Agreement. </p>
